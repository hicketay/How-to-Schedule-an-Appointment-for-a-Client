# How to Schedule an Appointment for a Client

Scheduling appointments is the primary task for you, a Student Legal Services employee. If a client received an Appointment letter template, they can call or come in to schedule one. To schedule an appointment, you will use both Maxient and the Outlook calendar feature. First, you will need to retrieve the client’s case file in Maxient in order to find:

- their issue type, and
- grade classification.

This information will go into the Outlook appointment form you create which helps Leslie Charters, the primary attorney, distinguish each appointment from another.

Follow the workflow below to schedule an appointment for a client. For better understanding, please read the Key before beginning.
